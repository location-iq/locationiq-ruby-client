## Installation

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build openapi_client.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem
```

(for development, run `gem install --dev ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'openapi_client', '~> 1.0.0'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/location-iq/locationiq-ruby-client, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'openapi_client', :git => 'https://github.com/location-iq/locationiq-ruby-client.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:

```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'openapi_client'

# Setup authorization
OpenapiClient.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: key
  config.api_key['key'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  #config.api_key_prefix['key'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = OpenapiClient::AutocompleteApi.new
q = '\"Empire state\"' # String | Address to geocode
normalizecity = 1 # Integer | For responses with no city value in the address section, the next available element in this order - city_district, locality, town, borough, municipality, village, hamlet, quarter, neighbourhood - from the address section will be normalized to city. Defaults to 1 for SDKs.
opts = {
  limit: 10, # Integer | Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10.
  viewbox: '\"-132.84908,47.69382,-70.44674,30.82531\"', # String | The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. Tuple of 4 floats. Any two corner points of the box - `max_lon,max_lat,min_lon,min_lat` or `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` - are accepted in any order as long as they span a real box. 
  bounded: 1, # Integer | Restrict the results to only items contained with the viewbox
  countrycodes: '\"us\"', # String | Limit search to a list of countries.
  accept_language: '\"en\"', # String | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native
  tag: '\"place\"' # String | Restricts the autocomplete search results to elements of specific OSM class and type.  Example - To restrict results to only class place and type city: tag=place:city, To restrict the results to all of OSM class place: tag=place
}

begin
  result = api_instance.autocomplete(q, normalizecity, opts)
  p result
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling AutocompleteApi->autocomplete: #{e}"
end

```
