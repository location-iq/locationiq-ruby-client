```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'locationiq-ruby-client'

# Setup authorization
LocationIQClient.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: key
  config.api_key['key'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  #config.api_key_prefix['key'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = LocationIQClient::AutocompleteApi.new
q = 'Empire state' # String | Address to geocode
normalizecity = 1 # Integer | For responses with no city value in the address section, the next available element in this order - city_district, locality, town, borough, municipality, village, hamlet, quarter, neighbourhood - from the address section will be normalized to city. Defaults to 1 for SDKs.
opts = {
  limit: 10, # Integer | Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10.
  viewbox: '-132.84908,47.69382,-70.44674,30.82531', # String | The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. Tuple of 4 floats. Any two corner points of the box - `max_lon,max_lat,min_lon,min_lat` or `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` - are accepted in any order as long as they span a real box. 
  bounded: 1, # Integer | Restrict the results to only items contained with the viewbox
  countrycodes: 'us', # String | Limit search to a list of countries.
  accept_language: 'en', # String | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native
  tag: 'place' # String | Restricts the autocomplete search results to elements of specific OSM class and type.  Example - To restrict results to only class place and type city: tag=place:city, To restrict the results to all of OSM class place: tag=place
}

begin
  result = api_instance.autocomplete(q, normalizecity, opts)
  p result
rescue LocationIQClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling AutocompleteApi->autocomplete: #{e}"
end

```
